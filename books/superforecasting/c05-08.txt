george soros often says a key aspect to his success is his ability to step back from his inital idea, wonder if there's a different perspective to challenge it -- in his own mind

first 10ish pages mainly about being ok with continuous representations of certainty (not the yes/no dichotomy)
epistemic uncertainty - don't know it, but it is theoretically knowable
aleatory uncertainty  - don't know it, and it is unknowable
the more granular the predicions, the better
counterfactual thinking - pondering about how things may have turned out than they otherwise did
p. 149 - survey, all were asked about a turning point in their lives, half were asked to describe it, half were asked to envision the alternate paths.  those in the latter were more likely to ascribe the event to fate
p. 152 - survey, all were asked pro-fate and pro-probabilistic thinking statements, whether they agree with them or not.  low score ==> rejection of fate, high score ==> had to be fate/divined. 4 groups surveyed, general public[mid score], Upenn undergrads[mid-low score], forecasters[low score], superforecasters [lowest score].  Additionally, plotted against the brier scores, there was a 'significat correlation', meaning the more someone rejects fate as a means of thinking, the more likely they are to succeed in forecasting accuracy.

John Keynes - "When the facts change, I change my mind"
superforecasters update predictions much more than regular forecasters.
p. 161 - getting people to commit to a belief is a great way to freeze it in place, making it resistant to change
jenga tower - stronger beliefs or commitment to a belief about a topic make it harder to change your mind about your position on that topic... more resistant to updating your beliefs on that opinion.  closer to the bottom of the jenga tower than the top, where blocks are easier to remove.
