- early 19th century - Pierre-Simon Laplace - if all is known about the past and present moment, then the future can be deterministically mapped out
- mid 20th century - Edward Lorenz - very minute changes in nonlinear systems can  (butcreate vast changes in output (butterfly effect)
- we are more aware now that we know less about how to forecast going forward
- forecasting ability less about what one knows, more about how one thinks

2nd century - Galen - "elixir cures the disease in all cases, except those which ar incurable" ==> medicine was evangelical
19th century - Thomsonianism - theory that excess cold in the body is source of illness
1747 - James Lind - accidentally discovers cure to scurvy as citrus by dividing people into 6 experiment groups and giving them different treatments.  Doesn't take away the method or even results of findings.
confirmation bias
“declarations of high confidence mainly tells you that an individual has constructed a coherent story, not necessarily that the story is true." -Daniel Kahneman
attribue substitution
intuition/analysis dichotomy
forecasts need to be equipped with a tablespoon of doubt

measuring
mid 20th century - Sherman Kent - realized that forecasting "probable" was too subjective for forecasting purposes, so created a mapping of forecasting probabilities to words that is still in use.
resolution and calibration for judging forecasting methods is important, not simply asking whether the forecast was right or wrong
fox/hedgehog (the fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing)

IARPA - paid for a project to understand how to improve forecasting accuracy in IC.
GJP - Good judgment project - competed in the IARPA tournament against the control group (current operating procedure).  found elite superforecasters who were much better at forecasting than top analysts
yale labs - coin flip experiment - illusion of control
regression to the mean - in a coin flip scenario, where trials have 0 correlation, one can expect a good forecaster of 100 flips to quickly regress to the mean.  in a scenario of skill, one can expect a slower regression to the mean
