qatar north gas fields was a mobil asset, which exxon was unaware of the value for at the time it was acquired, but LR later claimed "it alone paid for the cost of the merger".
saudi arabia sees qatar opening up access to natural gas, realizes that oil-based energy infrastructure needs to be changed to an alternative energy source (burning 200-300k barrels of oil / day to power the country).  Opens up the project to all major oil company CEOs in early 00s.
LR convinces greenspan/cheney that US cannot rely on gas resources, will need to build infrastructure to import.

The Haifa pipeline, originally not at all in the plans pre-iraq war, suddenly became a common talking point in discussions with the pentagon-lead oil-transition team in iraq, headed by a former Mobil executive Gary Vogler.  Iraqi's did not want to hear any discussions of this type, since it would reinforce an already widely-viewed notion that the US were in Iraq to pump oil out and into Israel.

As anti-american insurgency intensified in 2004, Iraqi's ability to manage state affairs becomes a challenge, making oil management near impossible.  "access to Iraq's oil did not need to be an explicit cause of the Bush administration's invasion to become an outcome."  p. 237

Douglas Feith, under secretary of Defense for policy, organized a talk with Chinese government leaders trying to convince them of the vision of a global oil market, whereby short term oil embargos did not have long term emergency implications on the price of oil, instead trying to convince them of the global oil "pool", whereby oil produced in sudan and indonesia have the same price.  Chinese were not convinced, nor were their fears allayed by the war in Iraq.

"creation of a free-flowing global oil market, one shaped to the highest possible degree by market incentives, would promote American national security, ExxonMobil's representatives insisted."

In 2004, LR and Exxonmobil were concerned about replacing their reserves.  They were barely gaining enough assets to replace the reserves they had sold.  geologists from the upstream division performed a 360 degree review of the reserve prospects worldwide.  revisited old assumptions.  "They looked everywhere."  Iraq offered a potential replacement, but LR counseled patience.

"Throughout his cultivation of the Bush administration.. LR purposefully kept them at arm's length.  It was not in EM's best interest to become tainted by failed nation-building in a country that held one of the world's largest unproduced oil and gas reserves.  American neoimperial ambition in Iraq may fail, but EM's private empire had other enduring interests, and these should not be rushed."

In summary, Every oil company was interested in Iraqi oil, but it was clear the Bush administration lacked the capacity to make a politically secure, economically rewarding deal in Iraq anytime soon.
