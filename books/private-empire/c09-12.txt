qatar north gas fields was a mobil asset, which exxon was unaware of the value for at the time it was acquired, but LR later claimed "it alone paid for the cost of the merger".
saudi arabia sees qatar opening up access to natural gas, realizes that oil-based energy infrastructure needs to be changed to an alternative energy source (burning 200-300k barrels of oil / day to power the country).  Opens up the project to all major oil company CEOs in early 00s.
LR convinces greenspan/cheney that US cannot rely on gas resources, will need to build infrastructure to import.
