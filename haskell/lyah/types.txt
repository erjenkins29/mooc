#### Typeclasses
Eq      : all types for which one can test equality
Ord     : all types which have an ordering.  can be GT, LT, or EQ
Show    : can be presented as string.  Most common used function with this typeclass is "show"
Read    : reverse of Show... takes a string and returns a type that is a member of Read
  e.g.   read "True" || False
         read "5"    :: Float
Enum    : for sequentially ordered types that can be enumerated.  Also have defined successors and predecessors, so one can use the succ and pred functions 
Bounded : have an upper and lower bound
Num     : numeric type class
Integral: also numeric, but only includes whole numbers.  (Int and Integer are types)
Floating: only floating point numbers, like Float and Double
