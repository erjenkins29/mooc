RUN THE CODE:

cd to this directory, run octave shell.

In octave shell...
> load dataset1
> w = learn_perceptron(neg_examples_nobias, pos_examples_nobias, w_init, w_gen_feas)

OUTPUT: charts of the perceptron algorithm converging to a solution

GOAL: 
1. understand linear separability of inputs
2. that perceptron learning algorithm will converge for a linearly separable set of inputs
3. that the distance between the weight vector and a 'generously feasible' weight vector decreases monotonically as one iterates through the full set of training cases
